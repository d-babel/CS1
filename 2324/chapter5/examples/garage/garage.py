# Read about Python dictionaries here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp
# car1 is a dict. It contains keys and values. "make" is a key. "Toyota" is a value.
car1 = {"make":"Toyota", "model":"Corolla", "year":"2015", "color":"green"}

# This returns the value associated with the key "make"
str = car1["make"]
print(str)

# print out "I have a green 2015 Toyota Corolla" where the values are filled in from the dict.

# create at least three more cars with keys for make, model, year, and color.

# create a list called "garage" that contains all of these cars.

# print the contents of your garage.
#print(garage)

# You got a brand new car! You get to choose the make, model, year, and color.
# Now add it to the garage. Bonus if you can create the car and add it
# in a single line of code.

# Iterate through the list and print out "I have a [color] [make] [model]" for each car in the garage.

# Iterate through the list and print out every car that is newer than 2020.
