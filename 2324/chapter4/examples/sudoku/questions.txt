Notice that main calls strcmp. What does it mean if strcmp, when passed two strings as arguments, returns 0?
    It means the two strings are identical. strcmp compares two strings character by character and returns 0 if every character identical to the one in the second string.

How would you rewrite the line below, excerpted from main, using only if and else?
int max = (strcmp(g.level, "debug") == 0) ? 9 : 1024;
    int max;
   if (strcmp(g.level, "debug") == 0) {
        max = 9;
    } else {
        max = 1048
    }

Under what circumstances might the call to sscanf below, excerpted from main, return 2 instead of 1?
sscanf(argv[2], " %d %c", &g.number, &c)
    It would return 2 if arg[2] contains a string that starts with an integer followed by a space followed by a character. sscanf matches and assigns values according to the format specified. So, itwill return 2if ti successfully reads an integer and a character into g.number and c, respectively.

What fields in g represent the coordinates at which the userâ€™s cursor belongs?
    The fields inthe global struct 'g' that represent the cursors coordinates are g.x and g.y for horizontal and vertial position.

5. What function (that we wrote) can you call to make the cursor actually appear at those coordinates? (Hint: we told you a little earlier in the problem set!)
    show_cursor

Around what line number in main could you add additional case statements to handle keystrokes besides N, R, and ctrl-L?
    Additional case statements for keystrokes could be added within the 'switch' statement in the 'main' function.

Most n00b and l33t boards have lots of blanks. How many blanks are in debug #1? Debug #2? Debug #9?
